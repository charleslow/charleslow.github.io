Older d3.js visualizations:

* [Visualising the Binomial Coefficient](https://charleslow.github.io/binomial_coefficient) - How many ways can we pick 3 balls out of 5 balls? This visualisation provides some intuition on the formula for calculating this figure, also known as the binomial coefficient.

* [SSOC Tree Diagram](https://charleslow.github.io/ssoc_plot) - Exploring d3 treemaps. The [Singapore Standard Occupation Classification](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/methodologies-standards/statistical-standards-and-classifications/SSOC) makes a good use case for tree diagrams due to its hierarchical nature. This way of representing the data makes it a lot easier to navigate.

* [HDB Dwelling Units](https://charleslow.github.io/flats_per_town) - Exploring transitions in d3. Data taken from data.gov.sg.
