## Charles' Github Page

This is a page of my random projects which I'm presently curious about.

For a start, I'm currently learning d3.js to explore more ways of communicating data insights. Some examples are: 
* [d3.js visualisation of Singapore planning areas](https://charleslow.github.io/planning_area_plot) - Exploring d3 maps and zooming.
* [SSOC Tree Diagram](https://charleslow.github.io/ssoc_plot) - Exploring d3 treemaps. The [Singapore Standard Occupation Classification](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/methodologies-standards/statistical-standards-and-classifications/SSOC) makes a good use case for tree diagrams due to its hierarchical nature. This way of representing the data makes it a lot easier to navigate.
