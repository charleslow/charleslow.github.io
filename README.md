## Charles' Github Page

This is a page of my random projects which I'm presently curious about.

For a start, I'm currently learning d3.js to explore more ways of communicating data insights. Some examples are: 

* [d3.js visualisation of Singapore planning areas](https://charleslow.github.io/planning_area_plot) - Exploring d3 maps and zooming.

* [SSOC Tree Diagram](https://charleslow.github.io/ssoc_plot) - Exploring d3 treemaps. The [Singapore Standard Occupation Classification](http://www.singstat.gov.sg/methodologies-standards/statistical-standards-and-classifications/SSOC) makes a good use case for tree diagrams due to its hierarchical nature. This way of representing the data makes it a lot easier to navigate.

* [HDB Dwelling Units](https://charleslow.github.io/flats_per_town) - Exploring transitions in d3. Data taken from data.gov.sg.

* [Simpson's Paradox](https://charleslow.github.io/simpsons_paradox) - Simpson's paradox is a classic statistical [phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). This visualisation helps us develop some intuition to how this might happen. Inspired by the jellybeans example raised by Joe Blitzstein in his Statistics 110 class.

* [Visualising the Binomial Coefficient](https://charleslow.github.io/binomial_coefficient) - How many ways can we pick 3 balls out of 5 balls? This visualisation provides some intuition on the formula for calculating this figure, also known as the binomial coefficient.

I'm also taking Andrew Ng's Deep learning course:
* [Softmax Classification of MNIST from Scratch](https://charleslow.github.io/softmax_from_scratch) - This is an implementation derived from Andrew Ng's code to implement a softmax classifier which achieves 96% accuracy on MNIST digit recognition using just numpy. It shows the power of deep learning using relatively simple code.

I'm also learning discrete choice models:
* [Multinomial Logit Exercises](https://charleslow.github.io/multinomial_logit) - Working through Kenneth Train's exercises on multinomial logit using the mlogit R package.
