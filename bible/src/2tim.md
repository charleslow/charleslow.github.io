# 2 Timothy

In light of the opposition of false teachers that Timothy was facing, Paul writes this personal letter to Timothy to encourage him in his ministry. 

<Do not be ashamed.> The theme of not being ashamed of the gospel is repeated 3 times in the first chapter. In v8, Paul tells Tim to not be ashamed of the <testimony about Jesus> nor of Paul's imprisonment. We generally long to be associated with the upper classes of society, where class is determined by what our present society values, e.g. power, fame, riches, intellect. It is thus counter-intuitive to desire to be associated with what others ridicule and look down upon. The message of Jesus, a crucified criminal, far from its present acceptance in our society, was probably viewed quite differently back in the apostle's day. To identify with Christ thus brings shame and humiliation from at least some members of the public and possibly the false teachers.

The shame of the gospel seems to take on a slightly different note today. It is socially acceptable to be a *Christian*, and being one is even viewed in a slightly positive light sometimes, since Christians are perceived to be kind and perhaps even belonging to a certain socio-economic status. The shame of the gospel seems to be more of being <too serious> about Jesus. Society smiles at faith that leads one to be kind, successful and full of good works.
