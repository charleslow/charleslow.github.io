\B 1tim 1:3-7

<Speculation vs Stewardship>. Certain persons read the bible with the goal of speculation, i.e trying to invent their own meaning from the text. In contrast, Paul urges for stewardship, which is trying to discern and understand what God is saying to us through the text. In the former case, the false teachers view the bible as something which they own and can use for their own purposes; in the latter, we are merely stewards entrusted with handling something precious that does not belong to us.

Paul calls the speculation <vain discussion>, which means that there is a way of studying the bible that is fruitless.
