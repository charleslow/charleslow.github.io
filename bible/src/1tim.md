# 1 Timothy

\B 1tim 1:3-7

<Speculation vs Stewardship>. Certain persons read the bible with the goal of speculation, i.e trying to invent their own meaning from the text. In contrast, Paul urges for stewardship, which is trying to discern and understand what God is saying to us through the text. In the former case, the false teachers view the bible as something which they own and can use for their own purposes; in the latter, we are merely stewards entrusted with handling something precious that does not belong to us.

Paul provides further details on the heart behind such speculation - their desire is to be *teachers of the law*. Their focus is on the position of being a teacher rather than the effects of their teaching or the God that they serve through their teaching. Paul calls the speculation <vain discussion>, which means that the effect of such studying of the bible is ultimately fruitless and a waste of time. Paul also says they are <without understanding>, which suggests that true understanding of the bible is only possible if our hearts are transformed. Thus it is possible for secular theologians to spend their life studying the bible but not have a correct understanding of it.

In v3, Paul asks Timothy to lay a <charge> on the false teachers against such teachings. The motivation for the charge is not to assert authority but out of love (v5) - love for those who may be misled by the false teachers and perhaps even love for the false teachers themselves. The false teachers are accused of swerving away from such love themselves. 

So we see another contrast at the motivation level between the true and false teachers, between <love for others> and <self-love>. If we teach the bible in any capacity, we should be careful not to do so out of a desire for self-promotion but out of a love and desire for the growth of others.
