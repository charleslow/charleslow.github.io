# Weng 2021 - Contrastive Representation Learning

**Reference**: Weng, Lilian. (May 2021). Contrastive representation learning. Lilâ€™Log. [https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive).

This page just follows Lilian's notes on contrastive learning.

<Contrastive learning> seeks to learn representations such that related samples are close together and unrelated samples are far apart. A sample is typically represented by a 1D vector (or embedding). The literature on contrastive learning comes from a wide range of tasks such as semantic retrieval, computer vision, hence we may see the same ideas repeated in slightly different forms.
