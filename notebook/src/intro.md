This is a collection of my notes which I refer to on a regular basis. Hope it is also helpful for others stumbling by.

I think of these notes as mountaineering pegs. Often at the time of studying a particular paper or topic, the concepts are clear. Over time, however, only a vague impression remains, and I can no longer tussle with the issues. So these notes serve as pegs that I hope to use to re-scale an old hill, or at least scale it with less effort than starting from scratch.

Generally, I highlight main points <like so>, and put in-line code or numbers `like so`.
